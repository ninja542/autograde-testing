# New Documentation for nbgrader

## Definitions
_**assignment name**_ refers to the name of your assignment. Assignments can contain multiple notebooks inside of them.

_**source**_ is the folder inside the course that contains the original instructor notebooks.

_**release**_ is the folder that contains the notebooks to give the students.

_**submitted**_ is the folder that contains submitted notebooks from the students.

_**feedback**_ is the folder where feedback generated by nbgrader goes. The manual grading comments will also show up here.


_**student name**_ refers to the name of the student folder and the id the grades get stored into the database. *student_name* can have spaces inside it.

## The nbgrader workflow

The original instructor files are inside the _**source**_ folder, in the _**assignment name**_ folder .

The files inside the source folder are converted into the assignment files and header and footers are added and then placed in the _**release**_ folder.

The students work on their own version of the assignment files, and the files are placed inside the _**submitted**_ folder in the folder structure as shown: **submitted** -> **student name** -> **assignment name** -> **file**. 

The notebooks are autograded and then manual grading is done if needed. Then feedback is generated using `nbgrader generate-feedback` and the feedback is placed in the _**feedback**_ folder.

# Processing the notebooks

process_notebook.py converts the files in the source folder to the student version by stripping ANSWER cells and stripping output and then using nbgrader to generate the assignments to put the files into the release folder.

The D2L python script from Dr. Colbry will take files from students and place them into the submitted folder.
